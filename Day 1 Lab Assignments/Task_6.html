<!-- 
    Task 6:

    On contact page prompt user to enter his name, and his birth year and make sure that
    it is less than 2010, and then calculate his age.
    if user age isn't less than 2010 show him the same prompt again until user enters it (use
    loops).
    And after validating user input, write all user input on the page in that format:
    Name: ahmed
    Birth year: 1981
    Age: 30
