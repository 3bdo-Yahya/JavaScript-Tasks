<!-- 
    Task 7:

    Enter an angle to calculate its cos value then display the output

    NOTE:
        1- Math.cos(r * (Math.PI/180)) is used when user enter the angle in degrees
        because Math.cos() takes its argument in radians, so we need to convert it
        from degrees to radians by multiplying it by (Math.PI/180)
        2- Math.cos(r) is used when user enter the angle in radians
